    <h2>Course level information</h2>
    <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>

    <h2>Introduction to Website</h2>
    <p>This is my learning portfolio which is a database driven website that uses multiple web 
languages to function. It contains a home page which contains some course information and a image carousel. An About page which has information about me and a Projects page which contains image carousels of projects I have completed. Additional pages include a contact form and feedback page which both connect to sql tables for the information to be stored. The intention of this website is for future employers to look over my projects / contact or give me feedback.
